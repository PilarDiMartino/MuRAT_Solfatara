# MuRAT_Solfatara

MuRAT version codes developed for the paper Reconstructing hydrothermal fluid pathways and storage at the Solfatara crater (Southern Italy) using seismic scattering and absorption, submitted to Frontiers in Earth Science. 

The "Results_paper" folder contains the results of the simulations (at 4 frequencies) used for the figures in the paper.

The Solfatara Catologue (sac_SOL folder) is available on request to Grazia De Landro: delandro@fisica.unina.it





MuRAT - Multi-Resolution seismic Attenuation Tomography
=======
![MuRAT is a code for attenuation, scattering and absorption tomography.](https://github.com/LucaDeSiena/MuRAT/blob/master/MuRAT.jpg)

MuRAT is a Matlab Package for seismic Attenuation, Scattering and Absorption Tomography using Body and Coda Waves at multiple frequencies.

MuRAT measures seismic attenuation, scattering, and absorption from passive and active data, and models 3D variations of these parameters in space.

The group of active users (providing questions, feedback, snippets of code) is the [Volcano Earth Imaging group](https://www.lucadesiena.com).
